Customize Elemental UI of One Identity Manager Api Server Applications

## Description

Modify the Standard Colors and Styles of One Identity Manager Angular Portal

The colors and styles from the default themes of One Identity Manager
are hardcoded in customized node_modules. To modify the standard colors and styles
without creating additional themes, this script helps to write the customization  
to the tgz package of imx-modules.

## Important

The two elemental-ui files in the imx-modules can be adjusted by the manufacturer with each release. 
Therefore, it is important to run this script again when upgrading a release from One Identity.
